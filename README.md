## Disclaimer.
The software for this project was originally developed by Aaron Soloway. I've placed this project in my repo so it can be collaboratively worked on (as it had no repo prior to this).

## About.
This project aims to replicate the feeling of passage into another experience of temporality and life, of death and simulation.  In Chinese mythology, cicadas represent immortality and in nature, a cicada can feel like a puncture in physical space, cycling mathematically and biologically through measures of time. In Greek mythology, the hallowed grove is a place of purity, a path and a crossroads, and Delphi is the famed oracle of the ancient world. The burned trees, sourced from the recent fires, are meant to replicate a sense of place and things that have existed and exhausted. They also represent the embers of the ghost ship fire that my close friend Alex Ghassan passed away in, and this piece is an ode to his eternal matrix. -Jody Stillwater
